# Personal Site

This is a personal page I created using HTML, Foundation CSS, and Javascript while taking Web Design. The goal of this assignment
was to give me a greater familiarity with web design basics as well as using a new frame work. Currently the page isnt live but if
you would like to access it you can download this repo and open the index.html file in your browser. Everything should be available 
from that point./
