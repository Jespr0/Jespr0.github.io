                        <p>This is a project I worked on during my creative coding course at St. Thomas.
                            The course was about using javascript and the p5.js framework to create cool
                            and interactive programs. This was my code for the final project which I called the Human
                            Bench Mark Test. It had the user play three small minigames that would assess memory, 
                            reaction time, and hand eye coordination and give them a score. The program totaled out to
                            around 1000 lines of Code!

                        a game in Game Maker Studio 2. I was the lead programmer for the assignment so I developed a 
                        majority of the code. It is a two player puzzle game where one player plays as a dog and the 
                        other plays as the owner. The players must work together in order to be beat the levels.

                        where we had to create a game within only a week. On top of that we were required to only use 4
                        colors, 3 sounds, and just the mouse and 1 key for our game. Despite these challenges we created
                        a fun horror game where the player is chased by a ghost.
